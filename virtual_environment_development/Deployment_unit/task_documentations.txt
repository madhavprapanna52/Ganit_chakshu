Features list to work on 
    - For computations simplicity 
        ~ Data labeleling mechanisms in initial preprocessing is required }}
    - data handle framework required to select dataset }}
        requires involvation of java for speed and presission , still exceptions are their 

    - Making copy based - DATA FLOW AND EXECUTION OPTIMISATION IS REQUIRED MUST TO PREVENT CRASHES
